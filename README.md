## How To Get Good Results

![Good results Demo](./public/good_results.png)

The image samples used to teach the model what your face looks like are critical. Garbage in = garbage out.

- Enforce close-ups of faces and consider cropping so that the face is centered.
- Enforce images with only one person in the frame.
- Avoid accessories in samples like sunglasses and hats.
- Ensure the face is clearly visible. (For face detection, consider using tools like [Cloudinary API]

![Avoid multiple faces](./public/multiple_faces.png)

If you get distorted results with multiple faces, repeated subjects, multiple limbs, etc, make sure to follow these steps and minimize the chance of this happening:

- Make sure any samples uploaded are the same 1:1 height / width aspect ratio, for example 512x512, 1024x1024, etc.
- Avoid multiple people in the samples uploaded.
- Add "double torso, totem pole" to the negative prompt when generating.
- Make sure your dimensions when generating are also 1:1 with the same height / width ratios of the samples.
