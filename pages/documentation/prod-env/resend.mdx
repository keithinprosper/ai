## Creating Resend Account

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  Resend is not mandatory. You can use any other email service provider. Please
  keep the environment variable names as shown in the documentation.
</Callout>

To use SMTP service to send your email notifications within the app, you need to create an account on any email
service provider such as [Resend](https://resend.com/). Once you have created an account, you need an API key.
In case of Resend, you can get your API key from the [API page](https://resend.com/api-keys).

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

### Verifying Domain

Resend is an SMTP toolkit, hence, you need to attach a domain that you already have or plan to use with the
application. Navigate to the `Domain` tab and click `Add Domain` button. Enter your domain that you wish to use
and then enter all of the records provided by Resend with in the DNS Records section of your domain registrar
account. For a better guideline, you can follow the
[Custom Domain With Resend Tutorial By Codewithguillaume](https://youtu.be/7HNJLUMV_TY).

<Callout type="warning">
  Please make sure that you enter the `DNS Records` in the account you used to
  purchase your domain. Sometimes, users mistakenly enter the `DNS Records` in
  the hosting account.

### Replacing API Key

Once you have setup your domain, Navigate to the `API Keys` tab and generate a new key. Replace
`your-resend-api-key` with your original `Resend API key` from [API page](https://resend.com/api-keys). This will
help you to send emails using your email service.
