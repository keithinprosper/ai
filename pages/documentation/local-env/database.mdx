  Supabase is completely open-source. Personally, we're using Supabase itself to
  host the database. The experience has been smooth with no issues. You can also
  use its self-hosting capabilities to host it on your own server or using
  Docker as shown in the guide.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please make sure that Docker is installed in your system and is running before
  following the given guide. If you're looking for more options such as
  [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or other cloud platforms, visit the official

The database service used in Framecast AI is [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative. It is a
service that provides a Postgres database with a RESTful API, authentication, and real-time capabilities.

To use Supabase with for local environment, you need to install the following dependencies:

```json filename="terminal" copy
npx install supabase
```

After installing the dependencies, we need to start a local server for Supabase. You can start the server by running
the following command:

```json filename="terminal" copy
npx supabase start
```

This will start a dockerized virtual container in your local machine while providing you with the following values
in your terminal:

```json filename="terminal" copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = your-supabase-service-role-key
```

Once you have these values, you can replace them with in your `.env` file by following the given steps:

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Steps>

### Replacing Supabase URL, Supabase Anon Key, and Supabase Service Role Key

Replace `your-supabase-url` with your original `Supabase URL`, `your-supabase-anon-key` with your original
`Supabase Anon Key`, and `your-supabase-service-role-key` with your original `Supabase Service Role Key` from the
values provided in your terminal.

### Ensure Replaced Values For Public Variables

Ensure that the replaced values are also repeated for the public variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. For certain services, the public variables are used to access the values in the database.
