  keep the environment variable names as shown in the documentation.

To use SMTP service to send your email notifications within the app, you need to create an account on any email
service provider such as [Resend](https://resend.com/). Once you have created an account, you need an API key.
In case of Resend, you can get your API key from the [API page](https://resend.com/api-keys).

### Replacing API Key
 
Replace `your-resend-api-key` with your original `Resend API key` from [API page](https://resend.com/api-keys). This
will help you to send emails using your email service.
