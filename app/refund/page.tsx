          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-5">
            <li>
              <strong>Technical Issues or Errors:</strong> If you encounter
              technical problems that prevent you from receiving our
              service—such as the AI failing to generate headshots or producing
              unusable results—you may be eligible for a refund.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Service Not Delivered:</strong> If you have paid for
              headshots but did not receive them, you are entitled to a refund.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Duplicate Charges:</strong> If you are accidentally
              charged more than once for the same service, we will issue a
              refund for the duplicate charge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unsatisfactory Results:</strong> Refunds for
              dissatisfaction with the quality of headshots are handled on a
              case-by-case basis. As the output is subjective, please contact us
              to discuss your concerns.
